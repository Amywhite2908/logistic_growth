Question 1)

The Analysis: This analysis involves the identification of three key values for a bacterial population, with these being the inital bacterial population size **(N<sub>0</sub>)**, the rate of growth **(r)**, and the carrying capacity of the population **(K)**. To do this, the data from the csv file **"experiment1.csv"** is plotted, a linear model is fitted to this data, and graphically the fit of the model to the data is assessed. 

The results: the dataset includes recordings of population size from t=0 to t=4908. --------More on results--------.
The estimates are N<sub>0</sub>= 879 (population size when t=0), and K= 6e+10 (this is the value at which the population remains constant).
